# Mark Spam Bot

This bot is basically a tool for a Telegram group admin
who doesn't want to give any bot admin rights.

Usage is simple: add the bot to your telegram groups
and wait for a spammer to appear, or for somebody to type
`/spam`. At that moment you'll get a notification from the bot
with a link to the message.

You may need to explicitly subscribe to notifications
by typing `/spamme` in the group.
